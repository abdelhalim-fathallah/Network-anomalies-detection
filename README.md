# Network Anomalies Detection for Insider Attacks

## 📝 Overview
This is a **graduation project** by our team at **HIMIT**. The project focuses on detecting **network anomalies caused by insider attacks**. Insider attacks are malicious actions performed by users within an organization and are often difficult to detect using traditional security methods.

Our system uses **machine learning and statistical analysis** to monitor network traffic, extract key features, detect suspicious patterns, and alert administrators about potential insider threats.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect anomalies in network traffic indicative of insider threats.  
- Provide a **scalable and automated solution** for organizational network monitoring.  
- Generate real-time alerts for suspicious activities to prevent potential data breaches.  

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Collect network traffic using Wireshark/Tcpdump.  
- Extract network features from PCAP files.  
- Train AI models for anomaly detection:  
  - **Autoencoder**: Detects deviations from normal traffic patterns.  
  - **Isolation Forest**: Identifies outliers in network behavior.  
- Detect anomalies in processed network data.  
- Send notifications and alerts for suspicious activities.  
- Integrate results with **ELK Stack / Kibana** dashboards for visualization.
